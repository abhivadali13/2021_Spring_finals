# NBA Draft Lottery: A Monte Carlo Simulation

Project Background:

The NBA Draft Lottery determines the order that the 14 worst teams will select upcoming talent in the NBA Draft. 

- Every team is assigned a certain set of odds to pick #1 overall in the draft, with worse-performing teams having the highest chance. 
- The worst three teams will have equal odds at selecting #1.
- After the first four picks have been set, the remaining teams will pick in inverse order, based on standings. 

A typical lottery ball machine is used to carry out the NBA Draft Lottery. 

- Fourteen Ping Pong Balls (Numbered 1 to 14) are placed in a lottery machine.
- Each 4 digit combination of the 14 balls is assigned to a certain team. There are a total of 1,001 possible combinations, of which 1 is discarded. 
  - The teams with the lowest records are assigned the most number of combinations based on their odds. 
- Drawings are conducted to select the first four picks. The remaining picks are determined in inverse order of the teamsâ€™ records. 

In the Drawing Process, for each combination drawn, the lottery machine is mixed for 20 seconds before drawing the first ball and 10 seconds before every subsequent ball. 

- The team that has been assigned the combination that is drawn will receive the pick (1-4) in question
- If the same team was drawn twice, the result is discarded. If the unassigned sequence is drawn, the result is also discarded.
