        "available than most earlier semesters, so just avoid the pitfalls, apply yourselves the best you can and\n",
        "try to have some fun with it.\n",
        "1. You may choose to work as teams of 1, 2, or 3 students. Multi-member teams must clearly show\n",
        "collaboration from every member and are expected to perform at a proportionally-increased level\n",
        "of complexity, sophistication, depth, and/or scope to earn a high grade. Projects will be evaluated\n",

        "on plagiarizing, notify the instructor immediately).\n",

        "3. Do not choose a statistical Machine Learning-focused project. Enroll in Machine Learning Team\n",

        "should not be used here. NLP-focused projects are also out of scope.\n",

        "this is done on Github.com since you’ll be committing there as work proceeds. Make sure\n",

        "your GitHub repository is up to date with all the work you’ve done so far (code, documentation,\n",

        "resolve in your project at this stage, but you want constructive feedback from others. All students\n",
        "will also be submitting evaluations about other teams’ projects, details will be given in class.\n",
